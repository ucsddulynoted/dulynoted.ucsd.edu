        <h2>Step-by-Step Guide</h2>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>
            <h3>Make an audition appointment on Calendly.</h3>
            <p>When auditions season opens, simply choose a date and time that works for you, fill out the information, and hit submit.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Choose your song.</h3>
            <p>Choose a roughly one-minute segment of a song that best showcases your voice! Make sure it is in your range, add personality to it, and have fun! This is your chance to really show us what you're made of. Whether it's a hard and fast alternative-rocksong, a mellow ballad, or a jazzy rife, make sure your personality and style come through. Please avoid opera, rap, and musical theater. Feel free to sing the song in a different key than the original if it suits you.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Come to your Audition!</h3>
            <p>Please arrive at least 5 minutes before your scheduled audition time to relax and meet some of our current members!</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>The Audition</h3>
            <p>In the audition room, you will be met by a panel of up to three Duly Noted members who will walk you through some exercises to test your range, tonal memory, ability to keep rhythm, and familiarity with sight singing. Do your best don't stress! It's OK if you can't sight sing; we are mostly interested in your ability to showcase your beautiful voice. That take us to the last part of the audition; so take a calm breath, and sing a confident solo!</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>The Callback</h3>
            <p>On the last day of auditions, we will announce who is proceeding to the callback. At that time, we will email additional instructions to those who are called back. During the callback, we conduct a mock rehearsal where auditionees can meet each other and the full group, as well as expereince what it's like to sing with us. The focus here is to see how you perform in a group setting, bot musically and socially! Sheet music for the callback will be provided, but the best way to approach this portion is to have fun and be yourself.</p>

        <h2>FAQs</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h3>Do you have any tips for the audition? How should I prepare?</h3>
            <p>The best way to prepare for your audition is to practice your song! Make sure you feel comfortable and confident when you sing your piece. Try recording yourself singing and listening back so you can make adjustments. The most important things that we are listening for are tuning, vocal support, and control.</p>

          <li>
            <h3>Is experience necessary?</h3>
            <p>
              As with everything, experience is helpful but not necessary.
              <!-- TODO: Ask if the sentence below is necessary or comes off as arrogant -->
              We don't care if you have 7 years of formal training or 7 years of singing in the shower.
              Some of our members couldn't read music when they auditioned, but it didn't stop them, and it shouldn't stop you!
              There are people who sound awesome because they have a natural, untrained quality and talent, and you could absolutely be that person!
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Can I bring a tape/CD to accompany my solo?</h3>
            <p>
              Due to the unaccompanied nature of a cappella, we require that you also do your audition a cappella.
              However, you are allowed to read lyrics off of a device.
              If you are concerned about having a starting pitch, no need to worry!
              We are glad to give you any pitch you ask for from a keyboard before you start.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Who can be at my audition?</h3>
            <p>
              The only people allowed in the audition room are you and a panel of up to three Duly Noted members.
              Anybody else might become a distraction!
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Am I allowed to audition for multiple a cappella groups? Can I be in more than one group?</h3>
            <p>
              You are allowed to audition for multiple a cappella groups; infact, we encourage it so that you can find the right group for you!
              The a cappella community is tight-knit and supportive in every way possible.
              <!-- TODO: Check that this ins't a rule (I believe there are cases where this situation came up) -->
              While there is no formal policy restricting membership to one group, the time commitments involved with one group alone would likely prevent you from successfully participating in more than one group.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>If I make it into the group, what is the time commitment I should expect to devote to Duly Noted?</h3>
            <p>
              On average, the group spends 8 hours in rehearsals a week: two 3 hour full-group rehearsals and one 2 hour sectional.
              Rehearsal times fluctuate each quarter and are dependent on member's schedules.
              Also note that we spend a bit of extra time in competition years, to sing at gigs, and to record (all decisions made collectively).
