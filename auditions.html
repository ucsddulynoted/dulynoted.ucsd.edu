         <h2>Step-by-Step Guide</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>Make an audition appointment on Calendly.</h3> 
        <p>Simply choose a date and time that works for you, fill out the information form, and hit submit. <a href="https://calendly.com/ucsddulynoted/duly-noted-fall-23-auditions"> Click here for Calendly! </a> </p>
        <h3> Choose your song.</h3>
         <p>Choose a roughly one-minute segment of a song that best showcases your voice! Make sure it is in your range, add personality to it, and have fun! This is your chance to really show us what you’re made of. Whether it’s a hard and fast alternative-rock song, a mellow ballad, or a jazzy riff, make sure your personality and style come through. Please avoid opera, rap, and musical theater. Feel free to sing the song in a different key than the original if it suits you.</p>
         <h3> Come to your Audition!</h3>
         <p>  Please arrive at least 5 minutes before your scheduled audition time to relax and meet some of our current members!</p>
         <h3>  The Audition</h3>
        <p> In the audition room, you will be met by a panel of up to three Duly Noted members who will walk you through some exercises to test your range, tonal memory, ability to keep rhythm, and familiarity with sight singing. Do your best and don't Stress! It's OK if you can't sight sing; we are mostly interested in your ability to showcase your beautiful voice. That takes us to the last part of the audition; so take a calm breath, and sing a confident solo!</p>
        <h3>  The Callback </h3>
       <p>  On the last day of auditions, we will announce who is proceeding to the callback. At that time, we will email additional instructions to those who are called back. During the callback, we conduct a mock rehearsal where auditionees can meet fellow auditionees and the full group, as well as experience what it’s like to sing with us. The focus here is to see how you perform in a group setting, both musically and socially! Sheet music for the callback will be provided, but the best way to approach this portion is to have fun and be yourself.</p>
 <br>
            <h2> FAQs</h2>
<br>
            <h3> Do you have any tips for the audition? How should I prepare?</h3>
       <p> The best way to prepare for your audition is to practice your song!  Make sure you feel comfortable and confident when you sing your piece.  Try recording yourself singing and listening back so you can make adjustments.  The most important things that we are listening for are tuning, vocal support, and control.</p>
        <h3>Where will the audition be? </h3>
        <p> Audition locations will be posted on the Duly Noted Instagram page on the day of the audition.  If you are lost or need help finding where to go, feel free to message us on Instagram or  <a href="mailto:ucsddulynoted@gmail.com" > send us an email.</a> </p>
        <h3>I signed up for an audition, but can't make it.  Can I reschedule? </h3>
         <p> Of course! Just send us an email at<a href="mailto: ucsddulynoted@gmail.com"> ucsddulynoted@gmail.com</a> and we will happily reschedule.</p>
         <h3> Is experience necessary?</h3>
         <p>As with everything, experience is helpful.  BUT, the difference here is that it’s not necessary.  We don’t care if you have 7 years of formal training or 7 years of singing in the shower.  Some of our members couldn’t read music when they auditioned, but it didn’t stop them, and it shouldn’t stop you!  There are people who sound awesome because they have a natural, untrained quality and talent, and you could absolutely be that person! </p>
        <h3>Can I bring a tape/CD to accompany my solo?</h3>
        <p>Due to the unaccompanied nature of a cappella, we require that you also do your audition a cappella.  If you are concerned about having a starting pitch, no need to worry!  We are glad to give you any pitch you ask for from a keyboard before you start. </p>
        <h3>Who's at the audition? </h3>
         <p> The only people allowed in the audition room are you and a panel of up to three Duly Noted members.  Anybody else might become a distraction!</p>
         <h3> Am I allowed to audition for all of the a cappella groups?  Can I be in more than one group?</h3>
        <p> You are absolutely allowed to audition for all of the a cappella groups; in fact, we encourage it so that you find the right group for you!  The a cappella community is tight-knit and supportive in every way possible (also, by auditioning for all the groups, you have more chances of finding the right fit).  While there is no formal policy restricting membership to one group, the time commitments involved with one group alone would likely prevent you from successfully participating in more than one group.</p>
        <h3> If I make it into the group, what is the time commitment I should expect to devote to Duly Noted?</h3>
         <p> On average, the group spends 8 hours in rehearsals a week. Rehearsal times fluctuate each quarter depending on member’s schedules.  Also note that we spend a bit of extra time in competition years, to sing at gigs, and to record (all decisions made collectively).</p>
