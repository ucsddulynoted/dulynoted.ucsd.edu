    <!-- About Us -->
    <section class="about-us">
      <p>
        Duly Noted is the seventh of nine a cappella groups found on campus at
        University of California, San Diego. Founded in Fall of 2012, Duly
        Noted has made strides to get to where they are today. Together, the
        members of Duly Noted sing and perform, united by a love of music.
      </p>
      <p>
        Comprised of nearly 20 talented students from UCSD, Duly Noted sings a
        diverse repertoire of music. Each year, the group sings new
        arrangements composed by our members. Duly Noted also hosts three
        yearly concerts, perform at on-campus events, attend festivals, and
        compete at the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella.
      </p>
      <p>
        Members not only share a love for singing, but also for each other.
        Duly Noted is a spirited group of people who work hard to achieve the
        group's goals, and still have time to devote to their passions and
        studies.  Some current and former members are successful programmers at
        Smule, Financial Analysts in SF, artists at AX, double majors,
        activists in our community, and Med School students. Duly Noted isn't
        just an a cappella group: it's an amazing place where dedication is
        key, friendships are made, and everyone has fun!
